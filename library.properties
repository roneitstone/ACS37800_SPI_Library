sentence=Adapted from SparkFun ACS37800 I2C Library for SPI communication.
paragraph=This library modifies the original SparkFun ACS37800 Power Monitor Library to work with SPI instead of I2C. I2C-specific functions and error flags were kept for compatibility but always return success since SPI communication does not use them. Original data processing routines remain unchanged.
